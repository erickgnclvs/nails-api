Me

from the main features, I think the most needed now is the review system for (appointments, services or provider? i think provider has the average of all ratings of appointments that were concluded) explain more about this idea and other features that may be important for an app like this (like uber eats or barber app but for nail services) 

You're right! Let me break down the review and rating system along with other essential features that would make the app more complete, similar to successful service marketplace apps like Uber or barbershop apps.

Reviews should include both numerical rating and text feedback

Would you like me to help implement any of these features? I think we could start with the review system since it's fundamental for building trust in the platform. We would need to:

Create the Review entity and its relationships
Add review-related DTOs
Create the review service and controller
Add review functionality to the appointment flow
Implement the rating calculation for providers
Add review display components to provider profiles




need to make a get providers to use the provider id to schedule appointment
